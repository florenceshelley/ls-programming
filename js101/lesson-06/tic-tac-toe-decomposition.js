 * @description Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player game played on a 3x3 grid called the board.
 * Each player takes a turn and marks a square on the board. The first player gets
 * 3 squares in a row-horizontal, vertical, or diagonal-wins. If all 9 squares are
 * filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is a tie.

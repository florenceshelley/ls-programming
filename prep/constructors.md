Identifiy the Constructors for each of the following methods and classify each method as either a "Static" or a "Prototype" method:

	* `substring`
	* `create`
	* `fromCharCode`
	* `slice`

Multiple constructors may provide some methods; be sure to list them all in your answer. You can limit your search for methods to the `String`, `Object`, `Array`, and `Number` constructors.

---

1. `substring` - _instance (prototype)_
	* `String.prototype.substring()`
2. `create` - _static_
	* `Object.create()`
3. `fromCharCode` - _static_
	* `String.fromCharCode()`
4. `slice` - _instance (prototype)_
	* `String.prototype.slice()`
	* `Array.prototype.slice()`
